### ModalFileManager

The Modal File Manager is a file manager program based on web technologies built with NW.js, 
Svelte, and Node.js. It's keyboard command layout is taken from Vim using modes to redefine 
the current key's purpose.

It is currently pre-alpha state and needing lot's of work right now. I will soon be open 
sourcing it to the community once some basic design philosophies are development and 
implemented.

If you are interested in keeping up with my progress, please file an issue with the subject:
